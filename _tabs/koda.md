Hello, I'm Koda, I am a 4-year-old golden retriever. I am currently persuing his a PhD in Squirrel Habitat Management. My favorite activities are terrorizing squirrls, being a dictator over my stuffed animals and my blankets, and chasing balls. I have done a lot of work to become therapy-certified, where I visit nursing homes and hospitals where I love to bring happiness to others. I am certified through Pet-Partners.
