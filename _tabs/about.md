Hello! I'm Zachary (Zach) Caterer, a Biological Engineering PhD student studying at the University of Colorado Boulder in the department of Chemical and Biological Engineering with a certificate in Inderdiciplinary Quantative Biology in the Biofrontier's Institute.

My Undergraduate education is from the **[University of Wisconsin Eau Claire](https://www.uwec.edu/)** where I double majored in [Applied Mathematics & Statistics](https://www.uwec.edu/academics/programs/undergraduate/statistics-applied-mathematics/), and [Biochemistry & Molecular Biology](https://www.uwec.edu/academics/programs/undergraduate/biochemistry-molecular-biology/).

## My Academic Adventures 

**Research with Dr. Wheeler:**
During your time at UWEC, you worked with Dr. Wheeler in the Department of Biology. We developed a user-friendly interface for high-throughput analysis of parasitic worms.

**Project Summary:**
The project, titled wrmXpress GUI, aimed to address the challenges in processing large imaging datasets generated by automated microscopy, particularly in the context of antiparasitic research. The data obtained from automated microscopy is detailed and extensive, but processing it can be daunting, often requiring custom tools or adapting existing software. To simplify this process, you and Dr. Wheeler developed wrmXpress, an open-source tool with a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). The tool is designed to analyze high-content imaging data across various worm species, with a special focus on parasitic worms. It incorporates previously published modules and introduces a new module for tracking schistosome miracidia in a high-throughput context.

**Research with Dr. Gomes:**

I collaborated with Dr. Rahul Gomes in the Department of Computer Science on two research projects:

1. **Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC):**
   We developed a scalable feature selection and deep learning framework to identify methylation sites in the human genome associated with PDAC. Our approach involved analyzing high-dimensional genomic datasets, including almost 485,578 CPG markers. By employing feature selection techniques and analyzing gene expression data, we identified key genes implicated in PDAC, such as "KRAS", "BRCA1", and "TP53". Our findings hold promise for improving diagnosis and treatment outcomes for this aggressive cancer.

2. **Artificial Intellegence in Tumor Classification Using FTIR:**
   We proposed a deep learning-based framework for automating classification in kidney tumor tissue microarrays (TMAs) using Infrared (IR) spectroscopic imaging data. By integrating feature selection algorithms with deep learning models, we achieved a classification accuracy of 95.47% for distinguishing Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma from Oncocytoma. This advancement could lead to the development of an advanced diagnostic tool for renal tumors, potentially impacting patient outcomes and treatment strategies.


**Research with Dr. Kamariza:**

As an **Amgen Scholar** at UCLA's Department of Bioengineering, I had the privilege to work with Dr. Mireille Kamariza on developing cutting-edge diagnostics for Tuberculosis (TB). Our project introduced a novel diagnostic approach that combines environment-sensitive probes with Octopi, an automated fluorescence microscope enhanced by machine learning. This innovative method allows for the rapid and accurate detection of live *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (Mtb), significantly improving upon traditional TB diagnostic practices.

**Project Summary:**
Our study utilized unique probes, DMN-Tre and 3HC-Tre, which are sensitive to changes in hydrophobicity when bacterial metabolism is activated, allowing visualization of TB bacteria in just 30 minutes. We captured this process using Octopi, which facilitated high-throughput and automated image acquisition. These images were then processed through a machine learning pipeline that integrates data acquisition with analysis, reducing the need for manual intervention and enhancing diagnostic accuracy.

In my downtime, I hang out with my 4-year-old golden retriever who's therapy-certified and he is persuing his a PhD in Squirrel Habitat Management.
