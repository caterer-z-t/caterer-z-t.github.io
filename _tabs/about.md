## My Academic Adventures 

**Research with Dr. Wheeler:**
During your time at UWEC, you worked with Dr. Wheeler in the Department of Biology. We developed a user-friendly interface for high-throughput analysis of parasitic worms. I had the wonderful opportunity to present this research at the Celebration of Excellence, Research, and Creative Activities (CERCA).

**Project Summary:**
The project, titled wrmXpress GUI, aimed to address the challenges in processing large imaging datasets generated by automated microscopy, particularly in the context of antiparasitic research. The data obtained from automated microscopy is detailed and extensive, but processing it can be daunting, often requiring custom tools or adapting existing software. To simplify this process, you and Dr. Wheeler developed wrmXpress, an open-source tool with a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). The tool is designed to analyze high-content imaging data across various worm species, with a special focus on parasitic worms. It incorporates previously published modules and introduces a new module for tracking schistosome miracidia in a high-throughput context.

**Research with Dr. Gomes:**

I collaborated with Dr. Rahul Gomes in the Department of Computer Science on two research projects. I had the wonderful opportunity to present this research at  the Celebration of Excellence, Research, and Creative Activities (CERCA), and the National Conference on Undergraduate Research (NCUR) respectively.:

### Project Summaries 

1. **Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC):**
   We developed a scalable feature selection and deep learning framework to identify methylation sites in the human genome associated with PDAC. Our approach involved analyzing high-dimensional genomic datasets, including almost 485,578 CPG markers. By employing feature selection techniques and analyzing gene expression data, we identified key genes implicated in PDAC, such as "KRAS", "BRCA1", and "TP53". Our findings hold promise for improving diagnosis and treatment outcomes for this aggressive cancer.

2. **Artificial Intellegence in Tumor Classification Using FTIR:**
   We proposed a deep learning-based framework for automating classification in kidney tumor tissue microarrays (TMAs) using Infrared (IR) spectroscopic imaging data. By integrating feature selection algorithms with deep learning models, we achieved a classification accuracy of 95.47% for distinguishing Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma from Oncocytoma. This advancement could lead to the development of an advanced diagnostic tool for renal tumors, potentially impacting patient outcomes and treatment strategies.


**Research with Dr. Kamariza:**

As an **Amgen Scholar** at UCLA's Department of Bioengineering, I had the privilege to work with Dr. Mireille Kamariza on developing cutting-edge diagnostics for Tuberculosis (TB). Our project introduced a novel diagnostic approach that combines environment-sensitive probes with Octopi, an automated fluorescence microscope enhanced by machine learning. This innovative method allows for the rapid and accurate detection of live *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (Mtb), significantly improving upon traditional TB diagnostic practices.

**Project Summary:**
Our study utilized unique probes, DMN-Tre and 3HC-Tre, which are sensitive to changes in hydrophobicity when bacterial metabolism is activated, allowing visualization of TB bacteria in just 30 minutes. We captured this process using Octopi, which facilitated high-throughput and automated image acquisition. These images were then processed through a machine learning pipeline that integrates data acquisition with analysis, reducing the need for manual intervention and enhancing diagnostic accuracy.

## Research with Dr. Walsh
I started my research journey with Dr. Michael Walsh in the Department of Materials Science & Biomedical Engineering, now at the New York Institute of Technology in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Throughout this tenure, I was granted the wonderful opportunity to present our findings at various research conferences, including the prestigious Research in the Rotunda in Madison, Wisconsin, the Celebration of Excellence, Research, and Creative Activities (CERCA), and the National Conference on Undergraduate Research (NCUR).

### Project Summaries

1. **Analysis of Bcl2-Associated Anthanogene 3 Mutated Cardiac Tissue Using Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy**
    This study delves into BAG3 mutations, known to cause severe cardiomyopathies, using Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). By analyzing cardiac cross-sections from transgenic mice harboring the P209L BAG3 mutation, we detected specific spectral differences indicative of pathological alterations in myocardial tissues. This research offers insights into the molecular mechanics behind cardiomyopathies and proposes a non-invasive diagnostic approach that could significantly influence therapeutic strategies.

2. **Differentiating Between Non-Alcoholic Steatoheatitis and Alcoholic Steatohepatitis through FTIR Imaging**
    Our research tackled the challenge of distinguishing between non-alcoholic (NASH) and alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) using FTIR imaging. The technique allowed us to identify unique biochemical fingerprints that differentiate NASH from ASH, potentially leading to more precise and less invasive diagnostic methods. This study is especially valuable in clinical settings where patient history alone does not reliably indicate the underlying disease etiology.

3. **Using Infrared Light to Improve the Diagnosis and Treatment of Patients with Kidney Cancer**
    This project explores the use of mid-infrared (MIR) imaging in diagnosing kidney cancer, particularly focusing on distinguishing between chromophobe renal cell carcinoma and renal oncocytoma. By employing both FTIR spectroscopy and Quantum Cascade Laser (QCL) technology, we demonstrated that infrared imaging can identify subtle biochemical changes in tissue samples, providing a non-invasive and accurate diagnostic tool that could greatly enhance clinical outcomes for kidney cancer patients.

4. **Artificial Intelligence in Tumor Classification Using FTIR**
    In the Walsh lab, we developed a deep learning framework to automate the classification of kidney tumor tissue microarrays using infrared (IR) spectroscopic imaging data. Integrating feature selection algorithms with deep learning models, we achieved a classification accuracy of 95.47% in distinguishing Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma from Oncocytoma. This project highlights the potential for advanced diagnostics in renal tumor identification, significantly impacting patient treatment strategies and outcomes.

5. **Comparing the Accuracy of FTIR Imaging and QCL Technology for Differentiation between Chromophobe Renal Cell Carcinoma and Oncocytoma**
    I contributed to research comparing the efficacy of Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) imaging and Quantum Cascade Laser (QCL) technology in differentiating between Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma and Oncocytoma. This study aimed to determine which technology could more accurately differentiate these two closely related renal disorders, thereby enhancing diagnostic accuracy and reliability essential for effective kidney cancer treatment and management.

6. **Spectral Pathology Lab Application Database (SPLAD)**
    During my tenure in Dr. Walsh's lab, I played a pivotal role in the development of a software program designed to analyze a variety of spectroscopic data, including FTIR, ATR, Raman, and mass spectrometry. This software, entirely written in Python, equipped users with tools for basic data processing tasks such as baselining, normalization, and the application of second derivatives. Moreover, it included advanced statistical processing capabilities, such as linear regressions, principal component analysis, and linear discriminant analysis. This project was not only crucial for enhancing our research capabilities but also served as my gateway to learning Python and developing coding skills. The software has significantly streamlined the data analysis process in our lab, improving the efficiency and accuracy of our spectroscopic studies.

## Personal Life 

In my downtime, I love to spend time with my 4-year-old, Koda, a golden retriever who's therapy-certified, where we visit nursing homes and hospital. When not caring for others he is persuing his a PhD in Squirrel Habitat Management.
