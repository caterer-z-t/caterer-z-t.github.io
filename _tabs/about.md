## My Academic Adventures 

While at UWEC, I delved into research with Dr. Wheeler in the Department of Biology. 


I've also collaborated with Dr. Rahul Gomes in the Department of Computer Science. 

As an **Amgen Scholar** at UCLA, I worked with Dr. Merielle Kamariza in the Department of Bioengineering. 

I started research with Dr. Michael Walsh  in the Department of Materials Science & Biomedical Engineering who is now at the New York Institute of Technology in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. 

## Personal Life (Because All Work and No Play Makes Jack a Dull Boy) üêï

In my downtime, I hang out with my 4-year-old golden retriever who's therapy-certified and he is persuing his a PhD in Squirrel Habitat Management.
