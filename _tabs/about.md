Hello! I'm Zachary (Zach) Caterer, a Biological Engineering PhD student studying at the University of Colorado Boulder in the department of Chemical and Biological Engineering with a certificate in Inderdiciplinary Quantative Biology in the Biofrontier's Institute.

My Undergraduate education is from the **[University of Wisconsin Eau Claire](https://www.uwec.edu/)** where I double majored in [Applied Mathematics & Statistics](https://www.uwec.edu/academics/programs/undergraduate/statistics-applied-mathematics/), and [Biochemistry & Molecular Biology](https://www.uwec.edu/academics/programs/undergraduate/biochemistry-molecular-biology/).

## My Academic Adventures 

**Research with Dr. Wheeler:**
During your time at UWEC, you worked with Dr. Wheeler in the Department of Biology. We developed a user-friendly interface for high-throughput analysis of parasitic worms.

**Project Summary:**
The project, titled wrmXpress GUI, aimed to address the challenges in processing large imaging datasets generated by automated microscopy, particularly in the context of antiparasitic research. The data obtained from automated microscopy is detailed and extensive, but processing it can be daunting, often requiring custom tools or adapting existing software. To simplify this process, you and Dr. Wheeler developed wrmXpress, an open-source tool with a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). The tool is designed to analyze high-content imaging data across various worm species, with a special focus on parasitic worms. It incorporates previously published modules and introduces a new module for tracking schistosome miracidia in a high-throughput context.

**Where to Learn More:**
To explore more about Dr. Wheeler's work and access the wrmXpress GUI:
- Check out Dr. Wheeler's lab page at the [wheelerlab.bio](https://wheelerlab.bio/).
- Find the wrmXpress GUI on [wrmXpress-gui](https://github.com/wheelerlab-uwec/wrmXpress-gui)

**Research with Dr. Gomes**
I've also collaborated with Dr. Rahul Gomes in the Department of Computer Science. 

As an **Amgen Scholar** at UCLA, I worked with Dr. Merielle Kamariza in the Department of Bioengineering. 

I started research with Dr. Michael Walsh  in the Department of Materials Science & Biomedical Engineering who is now at the New York Institute of Technology in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. 

## Personal Life (Because All Work and No Play Makes Jack a Dull Boy) üêï

In my downtime, I hang out with my 4-year-old golden retriever who's therapy-certified and he is persuing his a PhD in Squirrel Habitat Management.
