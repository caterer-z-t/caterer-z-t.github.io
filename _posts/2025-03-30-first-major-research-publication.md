## First Major Research Project Publication

Reaching this milestone is an exciting moment in my academic journey. This project was my first major research endeavor, beginning during my freshman year at UWEC, and has been years in the making. Iâ€™m incredibly grateful for the opportunity to contribute to research, collaborate with outstanding mentors and colleagues, and take part in meaningful scientific exploration.

## Acknowledging Mentorship and Collaboration
This work would not have been possible without the dedication of Dr. Walsh and Dr. Gomes, who were incredibly supportive and patient throughout this process. Their mentorship played a key role in shaping this project and helping me grow as a researcher. I am also deeply appreciative of the contributions from all the co-authors who worked diligently to bring this study to completion.
