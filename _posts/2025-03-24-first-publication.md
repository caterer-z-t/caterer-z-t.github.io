### First Publication

Reaching this milestone has been an exciting moment in my academic journey. I’m grateful for the opportunity to contribute to research, collaborate with incredible mentors and colleagues, and take part in meaningful scientific exploration.


#### First Research Publication
This work, completed with Dr. Nic Wheeler and the Wheeler Lab at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, represents a collective effort of dedication and curiosity. Being part of this project has been an invaluable learning experience, and I deeply appreciate the guidance and collaboration that made it possible.

#### First First-Author Publication
Leading my first publication as a first author has been both challenging and rewarding. This project pushed me to grow as a researcher, think critically, and develop new approaches to problem-solving. I’m excited about the insights gained and the foundation this work lays for future studies.

These experiences reinforce my passion for research and innovation. I look forward to continuing to explore new ideas and working with inspiring teams. A heartfelt thank you to my mentors, collaborators, and peers who have supported me along the way!
