I am thrilled to share with you the exciting news of my successful completion of my undergraduate degree at UWEC!

It feels like just yesterday when I embarked on this incredible journey filled with knowledge, growth, and unforgettable memories. The past few years have been a rollercoaster ride of challenges and triumphs, but I am proud to say that I have made it to the finish line.

During my time at UWEC, I have had the privilege of learning from some of the most brilliant professors who have not only imparted knowledge but also inspired me to push my boundaries and strive for excellence. The countless hours spent in the library, late-night study sessions, and group projects have all been worth it.

Of course, I couldn't have done it without the support of my amazing friends and family. Their encouragement, love, and belief in me have been my driving force throughout this journey. I am forever grateful for their unwavering support.

I am now ready to take on new challenges, explore new opportunities, and make a positive impact in the world. The knowledge and skills I have gained during my time at UWEC have equipped me to face any obstacle that comes my way.

In my next chapter, I will be attending the University of Colorado Boulder where I will be pursuing a PhD in Biological Engineering through the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineeering. I am also proud to announce that I was accepted into the Biofrontier Institute's Interdiciplinary Quantative Biology program which is funded through the National Science Foundations Integrated Data Science Fellowship. I am extremely excited to work with an amazing group of people.
