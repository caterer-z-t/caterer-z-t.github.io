# My Personal Experience with Spinal Cord Injury

I had and am living with a spinal cord injury, C4-5 Asia D. It has influenced who I am today. If you have questions, please feel free to ask. I'm more than happy to discuss this because, as a society, we have a duty to raise awareness of our differences in a respectful manner. While everyone faces personal challenges, some are visible, and some are not. It's okay to ask reasonable and respectful questions about these differences, but humility and empathy should always come first.
